# Pair(less) programming

I've been working remotely since 2016 and wouldn't trade it for anything.

Having more control over my work environment, finding the perfect work-life balance, and having more energy and fewer distractions (which lead to greater productivity) are something that, for me, is beyond discussion. I don't miss working in person.

You see, I was lucky enough to work with (and make new) friends over the past few years; this friendship allowed us to discuss, share ideas, accept mistakes and exceptionally acquire knowledge. But, most of all, having fun doing what I love: coding.

_There's one, though, that's special: **pair programming**._

That's right, the simple technique where two programmers work together at the same workstation, where one person is coding while the other is reviewing and providing feedback - after a few minutes, the roles switch.

We rarely worked individually. This became natural and very organic; we improved the code quality and shared knowledge and skills among the team - everyone grew together. Everyone understood all projects.

Seeing how another person reason and understanding the differences in thinking when solving a problem is incredible. Sharing is awesome. They say:

> "Shared joy is a double joy; shared sorrow is half a sorrow" - I couldn't agree more.

That's not the reality for everybody, especially after the pandemic; talking with people from other companies or even on social-media, I realized that this is not a common practice and that a lot of developers have been experiencing loneliness, difficulty connecting with people at work, lack of interaction, which can lead to a lack of separation between personal and professional life. Many people blame the remote work format, and I disagree entirely.

Self-awareness and common sense are essential:There are days when I want to work alone (but I don't feel lonely), and there are days when I want to pair (but I also respect other people's space).

If you work remotely and are feeling lonely (and wouldn't like to), it's worth trying something new. At first, it may be different, but if it works for a lot of people, it has a chance it works for you too.

After all, we are a community.
